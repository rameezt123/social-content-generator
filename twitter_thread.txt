🧵 1/8: 🍏 Is nutrition science up to the task of guiding our health? A new study by Mozaffarian & Forouhi dives into this debate, highlighting how the field has evolved beyond its early criticisms. Let's explore! #NutritionScience #Health

2/8: 🌟 Nutrition science has faced critiques for relying on observational studies and appearing unstable. But did you know it all began in 1932 with the isolation of vitamin C? This discovery helped eradicate nutrient deficiency diseases by 1980! #History

3/8: 🔬 Fast forward to today, and nutrition science is more robust than ever. With advanced study designs and new research models, the reliability of findings has significantly improved. #Research #ScienceInnovation

4/8: 🤔 Contrary to popular belief, there's often a concordance between findings from observational studies and randomized trials in nutrition science. So, it's not as inconsistent as some may think! #MythBusting

5/8: 🍽️ The field has shifted from focusing on single nutrients to understanding complex dietary patterns and their impact on chronic diseases. It's all about the bigger picture now! #DietaryPatterns #ChronicDisease

6/8: 🧠 Nutrition science delves into complex biological pathways, unveiling how dietary habits influence our health beyond just individual nutrients. It's an exciting time for the field! #Biology #Health

7/8: 🔄 Like cardiology and other fields, nutrition science naturally evolves. Evidence-based nutrition thrives on diverse types of evidence and consistency across study designs. It's not methodologically inferior! #ScienceEvolution

8/8: 🕰️ "The time lag between new knowledge and its implementation creates the appearance of controversy," say the authors. Let's stay patient and informed as nutrition science continues to grow! #PublicUnderstanding #PatienceInScience 🌱
